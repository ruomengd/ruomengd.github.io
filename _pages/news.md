* **Dec, 2023: XoT Code Now Open Source.**
We've made a leap forward in sharing our innovations with the world. The source code for the XoT project is now publicly available on GitHub! This marks a significant milestone in our commitment to open science and collaboration. Explore the repository [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Everything-of-Thoughts-XoT).

* **Dec, 2023: Spotlight at the FSE Conference.**
I had the opportunity to present our latest research at the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) Conference in San Francisco. It was a privilege to engage with thought leaders and exchange groundbreaking ideas that continue to push the boundaries of software engineering! Check the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YXnIW_s3ju7y1ZXG8CjsuoG4GFpbk5hY/view?usp=sharing) and my [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ruomeng-ding-ba3b08235_whova-activity-7139344913082564608-R9nu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

* **Nov, 2023: Arxiv Release: Everything of Thoughts: Defying the Law of Penrose Triangle for Thought Generation.**
"Everything of Thoughts" (XoT) is a novel method that combines pretrained reinforcement learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate domain-specific insights and efficiently solve new problems. Dive into our detailed explorationÂ [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04254.pdf).

* **July, 2023: FSE Paper Acceptance: TraceDiag: Adaptive, Interpretable, and Efficient Root Cause Analysis on Large-Scale Microservice Systems.**
Our paper has been accepted for publication at the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE). It introduces TraceDiag, an innovative tool that revolutionizes root cause analysis in complex microservice architectures. Check our paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18740.pdf). Furthermore, this root cause analysis (RCA) framework has been successfully deployed in Office 365!


* **May, 2023: KDD Paper Acceptance: Microservice Systems via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.**
Our paper, which explores the application of hierarchical reinforcement learning to microservice systems, has been published in the proceedings of the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference. Discover our findings [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3580305.3599934).
